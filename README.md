# DraftKings Lottery Components

## 🎯 Learning Goal
Convert Figma designs into React components to accelerate your prototyping and engineering communication.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Open this project in Cursor**
2. **Right-click `index.html`** and select "Open with Live Server" or use Cursor's preview
3. **Bring your Figma designs** - we'll build them step by step

## 📋 Our Workflow

### Step 1: Design Analysis
- Share your Figma link or describe the component
- I'll help you break it down into:
  - **Structure** (HTML elements)
  - **Styling** (CSS properties)
  - **Behavior** (React state/logic)

### Step 2: Component Building
- Start with basic HTML structure
- Add styling step by step
- Add React functionality (state, events, props)
- Test and refine

### Step 3: Real Component Thinking
- Make it reusable
- Add props for customization
- Handle edge cases
- Consider mobile/responsive design

## 🛠️ What You'll Learn

- **Component Architecture**: How to structure React components
- **State Management**: Using `useState` for interactive elements
- **Props**: Passing data between components
- **Event Handling**: Button clicks, form inputs, etc.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Showing/hiding elements based on state
- **CSS-in-JS**: Modern styling approaches
- **Responsive Design**: Making components work on all devices

## 💡 Perfect For

- **Prototyping lottery game features**
- **Testing interaction patterns**
- **Communicating with engineers**
- **Building a component library**
- **Rapid iteration on designs**
